# Quickly link your songs to your instagram profile!

Distrokid offers a service via [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9C_btqqUr9zQoQEwH525_z2ZAQazP5wU4ysTCyNo0KXmu9g/viewform) that enables artists to request that their music on Facebook/Instagram is linked with their Instagram profile. If you're like me and have a good number of songs to link, this process can take upwards of 7 to 10 minutes, and who has time for that?  

## Requirements:
- Python 3.9
- A Distrokid account that you've used to distribute your music
- ISRC codes for the songs you want to submit for review

## Setup:
1. First, navigate to the directory of the code, and in your terminal install the requirements by running ` pip3 install -r requirements.txt `
2. Next, paste the ISRC codes you wish to submit for review in the `isrc.txt` file. **Ensure that each ISRC code is sepearted by a line break, otherwise you will be submitting requests for invalid ISRC codes**
3. Run the script by going back into your terminal and typing ` python3 distrolink.py `. From there, you will be promted to enter in the information necessary to fill out the form.

*Remember, why spend five minutes completing a task when you could spend five hours automating it! Safe travels!*
